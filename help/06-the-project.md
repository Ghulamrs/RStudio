# 6. The project

A project is one file — **`prime.pro`**, named after the program it builds —
and there does not have to be one. Ordinary JSON inside; the suffix says what
the file is *for* rather than what it is made of, the way `.vcxproj` and
`.xcodeproj` do.

**`docs/sample.pro` is the template**: every key there is, filled in, to read
and copy. It is not a project and nothing opens it — a `.pro` is only looked
for in the directory you actually open, never one below, which is what keeps a
template a template. `examples/example.pro` is the opposite: a real, minimal
one that leaves four things to their defaults.

| key | left out means |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | the directory's own name |
| `arch` | this machine |
| `toolchain` | `auto` — the language chooses: C to cc1, C++ to the host's, Shalimar to shc |
| a group's `toolchain` | the project's, and then the language |
| `build` | no project program; Ctrl-B still builds the file in front of you |

**Debug or release is not in here.** Which of the two you are building is what
*you* are doing today, not a property of the program — and a project file
travels, so one arriving with a configuration in it would put everyone who
opened it into release. It lives in `~/.rstudio/config.json` with the rest of
what this machine had, `--config` overrides it for one run, and a `"config"`
key left in a project file is read by nothing.

**A directory may hold several.** `prime.pro` and `sums.pro` side by side is
the case the naming is for: opening the directory takes the first by name and
says so, and `Project ▸ Open project` lists them to choose from. Whichever you
opened is the one reopened next time.

**`Project ▸ Save as project file...`** writes one out under a name of its own.
That is the only thing that converts a project — see below.

## What was here before

It was one `RStudio.json` per directory, and `ed1.json` before that. Both are
still read, and a project opened under either is **saved back to it** — nothing
is converted behind your back, and a directory never quietly ends up with two
project files. Convert one when you mean to, with Save as project file.

With no project at all, the pane on the left shows the files you have open, and
nothing at all when none are.

`Project ▸ Close project` is how you get there from a project. It closes the
view and not the project: the project file is left exactly as it was, nothing is
taken out of it, and every file you have open stays open.

**It was called `ed1.json` until 2026-08-23**, when the last thing still
carrying the editor's old name was renamed with the rest. **Projects written
under the old name still open** — the editor reads either, and a project loaded
as `ed1.json` is saved back as `ed1.json`, so nothing ends up holding both.
Rename it yourself when you want the new one; nothing here will do it behind
your back.

**A file's name decides which group it is offered to.** A `.h` or `.hpp` goes
to Headers, a `.shl` to Shalimar, and the rest of what this editor compiles to
Sources - the same rule whether the project was written from a directory, the
file was added with **Add this file**, or it was made with **New file**. The
three used to agree only by accident, and a header added by hand landed among
the sources. Type a different group name over the one offered and that wins.

**There is no project file extension.** A project is a directory with an
a `.pro` in it, and that is the whole of what being one consists of — there
is nothing to look for called `.proj`. `Project ▸ Open project...` lists the
directories under the one you are in and opens the one you pick; a directory
that holds a project file is opened, and one that does not is stepped into, so
you can walk down to where the project actually is.

```json
{
  "name": "mixed",
  "toolchain": "auto",
  "config": "debug",
  "arch": "arm64-darwin",
  "indent": 4,
  "tabs": false,

  "groups": {
    "Sources": ["src/main.c", "src/util.c"],
    "Legacy":  { "files": ["src/old.c"], "toolchain": "c++" },
    "Engine":  ["src/engine.cpp"]
  },

  "build": { "target": "mixed", "groups": ["Sources", "Legacy", "Engine"] }
}
```

Seven keys, flat except the groups, and every one has a default — so `{}` is a
valid project file. Comments with `//` are allowed, because a file people edit
by hand is a file people leave notes in.

## Groups

A group is the project's own arrangement and has nothing to do with
directories: moving a file between groups changes two lists and nothing on
disk. The Project menu makes files, renames them, moves them between groups and
deletes them — the last asks you to type `yes`, because it is the only thing
here that cannot be undone.

**A group is a list of files, or an object that also names a compiler.** The
plain list is not deprecated: a group with nothing to say is written back as a
list, so adding a file to a project written before any of this leaves the file
looking the way its author left it.

## `"build"` — what the project makes

```json
"build": { "target": "mixed", "groups": ["Sources", "Legacy", "Engine"] }
```

- **`target`** is the program's name, without `.exe`. It lands beside
  the project file, so it is still there when the editor is not.
- **`groups`** is which groups go into it — deliberately not all of them, so a
  project's own tests, examples, headers and notes stay out of its program.

It also **sets the order**: groups are compiled in the order this list names
them, and that is the order the objects reach the linker. For Shalimar it
additionally **picks the program**, since every `.shl` has a `main()` and
nothing inside a file can say it is the one being built.

Saying nothing is not an error. It means the project builds nothing, and
`Ctrl-B` still compiles the file in front of you.

## A compiler per group

**C is the only language with a decision in it.** C++ goes to the machine's C++
compiler — `cl` on Windows, `clang++` on a Mac, `g++` on the Linux box — and
there is nothing to choose. Shalimar goes to `shc`, the only thing that reads
it. C is the one two compilers can both take: **cc1**, which this editor was
written for and which is the default, and the host's.

So a group naming a compiler is, in practice, always a group of C saying it
wants the other one. That is why `Legacy` above is the only group with a
`"toolchain"` in it, and why the C++ group needs none.

The words are `cc1`, `cl` (or `msvc`), `shc`, `c++`, and `auto`. `"c++"` means
*this machine's* C++ compiler rather than g++ specifically — which one that is
is a fact about a machine, and a project file does not get to have an opinion
about it. For the same reason the *paths* to the compilers are not in here
either; they come from `--cc1`, `--cl`, `--cxx`, `$CC1`, `$CXX`, or PATH.

**A group under `auto` holding two languages is split**, one part per language,
rather than refused. A group that names a compiler is one part and that
compiler takes all of it — which is the only way to make `cl` compile C as C++
on purpose.

## Two limits worth knowing

**Shalimar cannot share a target with C or C++.** In one group, because no
compiler takes both. In a group of its own beside them, because of what a
Shalimar object is — see [the Shalimar page](shalimar.md).

**One flat list cannot say "these files on Linux, those on Windows".** This
project's own sources are the example: `terminal.cpp` and `terminal_win.cpp`
are never built together. A project that differs by platform wants a group per
platform and a `build` entry naming the one you are on.

## Where a file may sit

The root, or one directory under it, and no deeper. As many directories as you
like may sit side by side — `src`, `tests`, `examples`, `docs` — but none of
them holds another. It is a rule the project keeps rather than a habit anyone
is asked to remember, because a structure nobody has to explore is one anyone
can read at a glance.
