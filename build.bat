@echo off
rem Builds WinConsole with MSVC, which is how it is built on the machine it is
rem meant for. There is no make on that box, and none is needed: a couple of
rem dozen translation units and one link.
rem
rem RStudioConsole.exe is this project's console editor on Windows.
rem On Windows RStudio.exe is the window - which is what somebody there runs -
rem and on a Mac or Linux, where there is no window, RStudio.exe is this one. - the same source as
rem ed1 on Linux and macOS, over the Windows half of the terminal, and named for
rem the machine it runs on so that the three variants can be told apart where
rem they are installed. See "The three variants" in the README.
rem
rem   build            builds RStudioConsole.exe
rem   build test       builds it, then builds and runs the unit tests
rem   build session    builds it, then drives the editor itself with keystrokes
rem   build check      both
rem
rem Run it from a Developer Command Prompt, or run it from anywhere and let it
rem find vcvars64 itself.
rem
rem The search is pinned to Visual Studio 2022 - the [17.0,18.0) below. A bare
rem "vswhere -latest" reaches past it to a newer Visual Studio if one is
rem installed, which is not the toolset this is built with.
rem
rem _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS is defined for the same reason cc1's own project
rem defines it: getenv and strerror are standard C++17, and MSVC's objection to
rem them is house policy rather than a defect to go and fix.

rem Before anything is built, because this one only looks at files. It needs no
rem compiler and no Visual Studio environment, and a check that rebuilds the
rem editor before answering is a check nobody runs.

rem The window, which is C++/CLI and which the console build above never
rem compiles. Run from here for the same reason the solution is: msbuild
rem reaches PATH only after vcvars64.bat, which the top of this file has
rem already found, so nothing else has to know where Visual Studio is.

:solution
rem **All four programs into one directory.** cc1, shc, this editor's console
rem half and the window, with both editors depending on both compilers so a
rem change to one and the change to the editor that goes with it are a single
rem build. This is what workspace.mk is on Unix.
rem
rem They land in x64\Release\ together, which is the whole point: the editor
rem finds the compilers it drives beside itself before it looks at PATH, so a
rem build that scatters them is a build you cannot run from. Two of the four
rem always landed there; cc1 did not, because cc1.vcxproj set OutDir to its own
rem project directory, and the window did not, because it was not in the
rem solution at all. Both fixed at the source rather than by copying afterwards
rem - see the comments in cc1.vcxproj and shc.vcxproj.
rem
rem Run from here rather than by calling msbuild directly, because msbuild is
rem on PATH only after vcvars64.bat - which the top of this file has already
rem found. One place knows where Visual Studio is.
rem
rem RStudio.sln reaches ..\Compiler-C and ..\Compiler-S, so all three have to
rem be checked out beside each other on this machine.
msbuild RStudio.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /v:minimal /m

:confirm
rem What the editor drives, and the check that it is actually there.
rem
rem The editor links against none of it. It *runs* these, and finds them beside
rem itself, so "built" and "usable" are two different states and nothing
rem checked the second until now. A shc.exe standing without its runtime
rem compiles, writes correct assembly and then dies at the link - which no
rem build and no suite could see, because -S needs no runtime. It waited for
rem somebody to press Run on a Shalimar file, and then read as a broken
rem compiler rather than an incomplete directory.
rem
rem Both runtime archives are named. Debug is the editor's default
rem configuration and links the other one, so checking a single archive would
rem confirm exactly the half that was not about to be used.

rem earlier that nothing refreshed. An editor without its compilers is not a
rem product; it is half of one that fails at the first Ctrl-B.
rem
rem shc's runtime goes too, and into bin\lib\ rather than anywhere tidier,
