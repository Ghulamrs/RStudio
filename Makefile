# this family carry one name each wherever they are.
#
# The binaries were called ed1 and ed1gui until 2026-08-22, on the grounds that
# the product name was what the pair was called and the binaries kept their own
# names. That is reversed: one name, everywhere.
#
# Everything except one file is ordinary C++14 and builds anywhere. The
# exception is the terminal, and even that is smaller than it looks: Windows 10
# and later understand the same escape sequences as a Unix terminal once
# ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING is set, so src/terminal_win.cpp differs
# from src/terminal.cpp only in how the console is put into raw mode. The
# drawing, the key decoding and the status bar are the same code on both.
#
# On Windows with MSVC, use build.bat instead - it calls cl directly, since

# The editor links against none of these. It *runs* them, and it finds them
# beside itself - path::besideProgram, asked before PATH, so that a compiler
# shipped with this copy is the one this copy runs. Which means "built" and
# "usable" are two different states, and until now nothing checked the second.
#
# That gap is not hypothetical: a bin/ was assembled holding shc.exe without
# the runtime archives shc links, and every build stayed green and every suite
# passed, because a suite that cannot find a compiler skips its cases and says
# so quietly. The failure waited for somebody to open a Shalimar file and press
# Run, and then read as a broken compiler rather than an incomplete directory.
#
# Both archives are named, not only the release one. Debug is the editor's
# default configuration and links the other file, so checking one of the two
# would confirm exactly the half that was not about to be used.
# c2s is here for the same reason the two compilers are: the editor runs it
# and finds it beside itself, so "built" and "usable" are two states and this
# checks the second. It is not a compiler and nothing links it - the Language
# menu's two Convert items run it over the open file.
