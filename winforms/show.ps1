.SYNOPSIS
    Starts the window, optionally builds, and saves a picture of it.

.DESCRIPTION
    For looking at the editor on a machine you are not sitting at - which is
    how this front end has been checked throughout, since it is built over ssh
    from a Mac.

    Two things about it are deliberate.

    It captures the editor's own window with PrintWindow rather than grabbing
    the screen. That gets the window even when something is in front of it, and
    more to the point it captures nothing else that happens to be on the
    desktop.

    A window needs a desktop, and an ssh session has none - it is session 0,
    and a program started there has nowhere to draw. So from a remote shell
    this has to be run in the logged-on session, which a scheduled task with
    /IT will do:

        schtasks /create /tn ed1shot /f /sc once /st 23:59 /it ^
                 /tr "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\path\show.ps1"
        schtasks /run /tn ed1shot
        schtasks /delete /tn ed1shot /f

    Run from the machine itself, it just works.

.EXAMPLE

.EXAMPLE
    .\show.ps1 -Files examples\smart.cpp -Keys "{F9}{F8}" -Then "{F6}","^2{DOWN 6}{ENTER}"
