// The seam between the managed form and the native editor, and the reason it
// exists is worth writing down.
//
// A /clr translation unit that instantiates std::string or std::vector, in a
// binary whose native translation units instantiate the same templates,
// corrupts the heap before main is ever reached - exit code 0xC0000374. The
// linker folds the two instantiations together and one side's allocation ends
// up paired with the other side's free. It was reproduced from a bare Windows
// Forms application: it ran, it ran with all nine native files linked in, and
// it died the moment one std::vector<std::string> appeared in the managed file.
//
// So nothing below names a C++ type. No STL, no editor headers, no classes -
// plain C declarations, opaque handles and char pointers. bridge.cpp holds all
// of it on the native side, and the form never sees a template.
//
// Every const char* returned is owned by the thing that returned it and stays
// good until the next call on that thing, or until it is freed. Anything
// returned as char* is the caller's, and ed1_free takes it back.
