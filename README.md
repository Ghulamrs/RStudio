# RStudio

An editor for three languages of our own: **C** and **C++** through
[cc1](../Compiler-C) and `cl`, and **Shalimar** through [shc](../Compiler-S).
It runs on Windows, which is what it is for, and on a Mac and a Linux box,
which are where it is written and checked.

Two programs over one core: **`RStudio`**, which is a terminal editor, and
**`RStudioGui`**, which is the same editor in a window. Those are the names of the
binaries and of nothing else - every rule they share lives in `src/`, and the
name above is what the pair of them is called.

> Called CC1 Studio Workbench until 2026-08-22, when the third language
> arrived and the old name stopped describing it.

It is not [CC1 Studio](../CC1Studio), which is a different thing for the same
compiler: that one is an extension that teaches VS Code about cc1, and this one
is an editor of our own.

## What it does

**It lays C out as you type it.** This is the part worth having. Type a function
with no leading space anywhere and it arrives indented: bodies in a step, a
closing brace under the line that opened its group, an unbraced `if` indenting
exactly one statement, `case` labels in their switch's own column, `#` at the
left margin. Braces inside strings, character constants, `//` and `/* */` are
text and are not counted. Tab in the leading space puts the line where it
belongs rather than adding a step; Ctrl-F does the whole file.

**Re-indent takes a selection.** Edit ▸ Re-indent, or `Ctrl-A`, lays out what is
selected and leaves every other line exactly as it was; with nothing selected it
lays out the file. Either way the *whole* file is measured first, because how
far a line is indented is a property of everything above it - how deep the
braces are, whether a comment is open - so laying out a fragment on its own
would start at column zero and be wrong from its first line. The selection
decides which lines are written back, not what is measured.

The rules come from Shalimar's indenter, which had already settled them, with
four things added that C has and that language did not: escapes inside literals,
block comments that outlive their line, the preprocessor, and switch labels.

**It builds, and lands on the error.** Ctrl-B saves and runs `cc1 -S`. cc1 stops
at the first error - `Source::fail` is `[[noreturn]]` - so this is a fix-one,
build-again rhythm rather than a list of twelve problems, and the editor is
built for that rhythm. The caret goes to the line and column cc1 named, and
cc1's own words, caret line and all, are in the console.

**It runs what it built.** F5, or Run in the Build menu, saves the file and
hands it to the compiler with neither `-S` nor `-c` - so cc1 compiles, assembles
and links it, and cl does the same without `/c` - and then starts the program
and puts everything it prints in the console, under everything the compiler
said. What it returned is shown as a number rather than as success or failure,
because only the program knows which its number meant: `[program returned 3]`.
Its input is emptied rather than left as the editor's own, so a program that
reads does not eat the keyboard.

Only for the target this machine is. Everything else is turned away before
anything is built, with the target to switch to named - the assembler and linker
cc1 hands off to are the host's, so a cross build stops at the assembly and
there is nothing to start. cl is never in that position: it builds for the
machine it was installed on.

**It stops the program on a line and walks through it.** F9 puts a breakpoint
on the line the caret is on - a `*` in the gutter, and no compiler needed to put
it there. A breakpoint belongs to the file rather than to the tab, so it
survives the file being closed and opened again, and follows the file when it is
renamed. F8 builds with `-g`, starts the debugger, sets every breakpoint it has
been given and runs; when the program stops, the caret goes to the line, a `>`
marks it, and the Debug tab says where it is and what is in scope:

```
stopped at stepped.c:11 in main

  total = 0   [int]
  i = 1   [int]
```

F6 steps into a call, F7 over one, F8 carries on, and the Debug menu has those
and step-out. Those variables are cc1's own DWARF, read back by the machine's
own debugger.

**And it says how the program got there.** Stepping into a call, the Debug tab
puts the stack under the variables - who is waiting, and on which line:

```
stopped at stepped.c:3 in twice

  n = 1   [int]

called from
  main   stepped.c:11
```

**And a frame is a place to go to.** Double-click one in the window, or press
enter on it - `Ctrl-W` twice puts the cursor in the panel in the terminal, and
the line it is standing on is the panel's top line. The caret goes to the line
that is waiting for the call to come back, opening that file if the call came
from another one, and the variables become that frame's:

```
stopped at stepped.c:3 in twice

the variables are main's, at stepped.c:11

  total = 0   [int]
  i = 1   [int]

called from
> main   stepped.c:11
```

`total` and `i` are main's and are not in scope in `twice` at all. All three
debuggers keep a current frame and answer with its variables, so this is
`frame select` to lldb, `frame` to gdb and `.frame` to cdb, and the reading
after it is unchanged. The line above the list says whose they are, because
`stopped at stepped.c:3 in twice` is still true and would otherwise be standing
over another function's locals.

`Ctrl-Up` and `Ctrl-Down` walk the same stack from the text, without going near
the panel - one frame towards what called this, one frame back down - which is
where you are when the question occurs to you. They are in the Debug menu with
the steps. The two ends say so rather than doing nothing: nothing called main,
and there is nothing below where the program stopped.

The way back is also the top line: it names the frame the program stopped in,
and pressing enter on it goes there. Any step goes back too - every stop starts
at the frame it stopped in.

**An expression can be watched, and follows the stepping.** Debug ▸ Watch
expression asks for one, and it is answered again at every stop and after every
change of frame, without being asked for a second time:

```
stopped at stepped.c:11 in main

  total = 2   [int]
  i = 2   [int]

watching
  total + i = 4
  twice(4) = 8
  nosuch = [use of undeclared identifier 'nosuch']
```

`expression` to lldb, `print` to gdb, `??` to cdb, and the answer read out of
`(int) $0 = 4`, `$1 = 4` and `int 0n4` - the `$` is what tells lldb's answer
from its echo of the command that asked for it. One it cannot answer keeps its
place with the reason in brackets, so the block never has an expression with
nothing after it; step into a function where the name is out of scope and that
is what it says.

The list belongs to the core beside the debugger rather than to either front
end, and reading it again is done by the moves themselves - a watch that only
some of the ways of moving refreshed would be worse than no watch at all. They
outlive a debugging session, as a breakpoint does. Enter on one changes it, and
an empty answer drops it.

**And a variable can be written back.** Enter on one in the Debug tab, or a
double-click in the window, asks for a value in the box that asks for
filenames, and it goes into whichever frame is being looked at - so a caller's
variable is set as easily as this one's. `expression` to lldb, `set variable`
to gdb, `??` to cdb.

What it reads back afterwards is what is in there rather than what was typed:
a debugger asked for `3.7` in an `int` stores 3, and the tab should say 3. A
value one of them will not take is refused in its own words - `No symbol "x" in
current context` names the mistake better than anything this could invent.

That it reaches the program rather than only the pane is what the tests check:
`stepped.c` returns 2 + 4 + 6, and with `total` set to 100 at the first
breakpoint it returns 112.

**The gutter marks the frame's line too**, so the answer is in the code and not
only in the panel: `:` in the terminal where `>` marks the stop and `*` a
breakpoint, and in the window the same arrow drawn as an outline rather than
filled in - the program is not standing there, you are only looking at it. A
dash was tried first and reads as a minus sign against a two-digit number.

It outranks the breakpoint on the same line, which is usually exactly where a
caller is waiting: the two marks are about now, and a breakpoint is about every
run of the program.

The program has not moved through any of this. The arrow in the gutter still
marks the line it is standing on: looking at a frame is not stepping.

The stack stops at `main`. Below main is the code that started the program,
which was not compiled here and has no source to go to - the same place a step
off the end of main arrives in. lldb shows one frame of it and gdb three, and
three lines of somebody else's libc above the answer are three lines to read
past at every stop. A program standing in main has a stack of one and the tab
says nothing about it, since a `called from` with nothing under it is noise.

It drives that debugger rather than being one - lldb on a Mac, gdb on the Linux
box, cdb on Windows - all three spoken through `src/debugger.cpp`, which is the
one place their vocabularies differ.

Which of them applies is a question about the compiler, not about the machine,
and on Windows the two languages part company. A C file goes to cc1 and comes
out as MASM, which carries no line table, so it can never be stopped on a line
there and the editor says why. A C++ file goes to cl, which writes CodeView
into a `.pdb`, and cdb reads it - so C++ is debugged inside this editor with
nothing of ours in the chain except the editor. `debuggerFor(kind, arch)` asks
that question; `noDebuggerBecause` gives the answer that applies rather than a
general one.

cdb comes with the Windows SDK's debugging tools and is not installed by
default; when it is missing the editor says that too, and names it.

**The line the program is standing on wears a bar** across the whole width of
the edit view, light blue, with an arrow beside it in the gutter. It is in two
halves and has to be: a RichTextBox colours the background of *characters*, so
that half stops where the code stops, and a panel of our own fills the rest of
the line out to the edge. Three tidier answers were tried first and none of them
draws - the notes are above `PaintRow` and `MakeStopBar`, so nobody spends the
afternoon again.

Both front ends have it, from that same core: the window has a Debug menu with
the same keys, a red dot in its gutter where a breakpoint is, an arrow where
the program is standing and an outline of one on the frame being looked at, and
the same words in its Debug tab.

There used to be an awkwardness here worth stating plainly, and it is half
gone. The window only runs on Windows, and Windows is where none of the three
debuggers can read what cc1 writes - so for C, F8 there still answers "no
debugger here" and sets breakpoints against the day there is one. **For
Shalimar it stops.** A Shalimar program carries its own session, needs nothing
installed, and works on all three targets including this one, so the window
stops on a line of source on the machine where that had never been possible.

Which of the two halves a program goes to is `dbg_stopsItself` and is asked
**before** `dbg_for`, in the core, by both front ends. That order is the whole
of it: `dbg_for` answers "none" for shc and is right to, and a front end
reading that as a refusal refuses the one language that needs nothing to be
installed. The window read it that way for a day and a half.

That is why `tests/test.cpp` links `winforms/bridge.cpp` and drives the
window's own seam - `ed1_build_program`, `ed1_debugger_start`, the stop and the
locals - on the machines that do have a debugger. Everything the window asks
the core to do is checked there; what is left untested is the Windows Forms
glue around it, and nothing else.

Two things about driving lldb are worth writing down, because both cost an hour
and neither is guessable. It must be put in synchronous mode with `script
lldb.debugger.SetAsync(False)`, or over a pipe it forwards each command to the
program instead of running it, and every answer after `run` is an echo. And the
marker used to know an answer is complete has to be printed in two halves -
`print("<<RStudio" + "-done>>")` - because lldb echoes the command that contains it,
so a marker written whole appears before the answer rather than after it, and
every reply read that way is the one before the one asked for.

**It shows the assembly for any of the three targets.** Ctrl-T, or the Target
menu. Two of the three reach `-S` and no further on any given machine, since the
assembler is the host's - which is exactly what the assembly tab is for. A
project that does not name a target gets this machine's, rather than the
`x86_64-windows` it used to get wherever it was opened.

**It colours what it shows, per language.** Keywords, types, strings, character
constants, comments, numbers and the preprocessor, chosen from the file's
suffix: `.c` and `.h` as C, `.cpp` and its family as C++, `.s` and `.asm` as
assembly - which means the assembly tab is coloured too, with cc1's directives,
labels and mnemonics told apart. A keyword inside a string stays a string, an
escaped quote ends nothing, and a block comment opened above the top of the
screen still colours what is on it. Sixteen-colour codes throughout, because
those are the ones a Windows console renders in virtual-terminal mode.

**Selecting, cutting and pasting.** Shift with the arrows, Home, End or the
page keys extends a selection from where the caret was; moving without shift
lets it go. `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-X` and `Ctrl-V` copy, cut and paste, and with
nothing selected the first two take the whole line, which is what is nearly
always wanted. Typing or backspacing over a selection replaces it, and a cut is
one undo step. The clipboard is the editor's own, not the machine's.

**Text that is not ASCII.** The buffer stays bytes throughout, so a file opened
and saved comes back byte for byte whatever is in it - but the caret moves by
*characters*, never landing inside one, and backspace removes a whole letter
rather than its last byte. Screen columns are counted properly too: an Urdu or
accented letter is one column though it is two bytes, a Chinese character is
two columns though it is three bytes, and a mark drawn on top of another letter
is none. Tab stops line up on columns rather than bytes for the same reason.

**Undo and redo**, on `Ctrl-Z` and `Ctrl-Y`. A run of typing is one step, so
undoing gives a word back rather than one letter at a time; a newline, a
re-layout and a replace are each a step of their own. Moving the caret ends the
run, which is what stops a whole session collapsing into a single undo. The
caret goes back to where it was, not just the text.

The `*` that marks a modified file follows undo properly: undoing back to the
point the file was written at clears it, because the text and the disk agree
again. That is done by remembering how deep the history stood when the file was
saved rather than by comparing the whole text - and when the saved point falls
off the end of the capped history it says modified, which is the safe way to be
wrong.

It works by keeping snapshots rather than by inverting each operation. A source
file is a few thousand short strings, the history is capped at a hundred steps,
and the simple version is the one that cannot be subtly wrong - which for undo
matters more than for anything else here.

**Find and replace.** `Ctrl-F` asks, `Ctrl-G` moves on to the next, `Ctrl-R`
replaces. Searching wraps round the end of the file and stops when it arrives
back where it began. Replace changes every occurrence and says how many - and
`Ctrl-Z` puts them all back in one step.

**Debug or release**, on `Ctrl-D` or in the Build menu, remembered in the
project file. What each compiler can do about it differs, and the editor says
which rather than pretending they are the same:

| | debug | release |
|---|---|---|
| `cl` | `/Od /D_DEBUG` | `/O2 /DNDEBUG` |
| `cc1`, `x86_64-linux` and `arm64-darwin` | `-g -D_DEBUG=1` | `-DNDEBUG=1` |
| `cc1`, `x86_64-windows` | `-D_DEBUG=1` | `-DNDEBUG=1` |

cc1 still has no `-O`, so for it release is the define and nothing else. That is
not nothing - it is what `assert` and every `#ifdef NDEBUG` in the source are
looking for - but passing it a `-O` it would refuse would be worse than saying
so plainly.

Debug is more than the define now. cc1 writes DWARF for two of its three
targets - line tables, types, objects and lexical blocks, read by both `gdb`
and `lldb` - so a debug build for those asks for `-g` and gets it. The third
does not: cc1 generates MASM for `x86_64-windows`, MASM carries no line table,
and the assembler there cannot spell the relocations CodeView would need. cc1
does take `-g` for that target in the GNU spelling, which routes the DWARF out
of the Linux emitter, but the editor asks each target for the assembly its own
assembler reads. So that target gets the define alone, and no `-g` it would
refuse.

**Line numbers down the left**, in the manner of Shalimar's, with the caret's
own line picked out. `Ctrl-L` turns them off.

**The panes are drawn in a box.** The project pane, the text and the panel each
have their own part of one frame, with the line between the panes running from
the top down to whichever line closes it - the panel's line when the panel is
open, and the bottom of the window when it is shut, where it ends in a tee
either way. The names go into the lines rather than onto rows of their own: the
files you have open are laid into the top line over the text they belong to,
and Console, Debug and Assembly into the line above the panel, with how much
there is to read at its right-hand end. That is two rows of names in one row of
line, and rows are what a terminal has least of.

**If your console draws them badly, `--plain` frames it with `-`, `|` and `+`
instead**, and Edit ▸ Plain frame switches between the two and remembers which
you chose in `~/.ed1config.json`. That is not a matter of taste: a font that has
the plain line but not the junctions makes the console fetch `┬` from a second
face, whose crossbar sits at a different height, and the frame appears to break
at every join. Nothing in the program can mend that, so this is the way round
it.

The characters are the box-drawing ones, written as UTF-8 - which is what the
editor writes anyway, since it has always handled files by the character rather
than by the byte. On Windows the console is put into UTF-8 for as long as the
editor is running and put back afterwards; a console left on the machine's own
code page would show those three bytes as three characters of something else.

**The menu and the questions are boxed too.** A menu hangs from its title in a
box of its own, and a question - find, replace, save as, the name of a new file
- is asked in a box in the middle of the text rather than on the message line,
which is also where the editor answers back. A question and the answer to the
last one sharing a row is how you end up reading neither.

**It does not flicker.** The screen is written a row at a time, and a row that
has not changed since the last time is not written again: a keystroke rewrites
the line it changed and the status bar, not the whole screen. On a 24 by 80
terminal that is a sixth of the bytes for the same typing, and the difference
is larger the bigger the window - which is what the flicker was made of, over
ssh most of all. The frame is written between the two halves of the
"show me this all at once" pair as well, for the terminals that understand it.

**Tabs for the files you have open.** Opening from the project pane adds one;
F2 and F3 move between them. Each tab remembers its own caret and its own
scroll, so coming back to a file puts you where you were rather than at the top.

**The file chooses its own compiler.** cc1 compiles C; C++ goes to cl. That is
the whole routing rule, and it is the default - the status bar shows what will
actually run, with a `*` when the file is what picked it. `Ctrl-K` cycles
through automatic, cc1-for-everything and cl-for-everything when you want to
say so yourself; a choice made by hand is kept rather than quietly overridden,
and a file the chosen compiler cannot take is turned away with a reason instead
of a wall of somebody else's parse errors.

Each compiler is also *told* which language it is being handed - `/TC` or
`/TP /EHsc /std:c++14` - rather than left to infer it from the suffix. C++14
because that is what this arena holds itself to: cc1 is written in it, so the
editor is built in it, and C++ compiled here is compiled as it.

**cl is found without a Developer Command Prompt.** RStudio asks Visual Studio 2022
where it lives, runs `vcvars64` once, and keeps the environment for the rest of
the session. Started from an ordinary console with `cl` nowhere on PATH, it
still builds C++. With `cl` in use the target chooser goes quiet, because cl
builds for the host it was installed as and a menu offering a choice that does
nothing would be the status bar telling a lie.

Both diagnostic spellings are read without being told which to expect:

```
file:line:col: error: message         cc1, and gcc and clang with it
file(line,col): error C2059: message  cl, and ml64
```

so pointing it at a third compiler that speaks either one needs no new code. A
`cl` run wants a Developer Command Prompt - that is where `cl.exe` is on PATH -
and cl's own listing is MASM, which the assembly tab already colours.

## The three languages

| Language | Suffix | Compiler | Targets | Debug information |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | `.c` `.h` | [cc1](../Compiler-C) | three | DWARF, on two of them |
| C++ | `.cpp` `.hpp` … | `cl` | its own host | CodeView, always |
| Shalimar | `.shl` | [shc](../Compiler-S) | three | none, by decision |

**The suffix decides, and the Language menu overrides it.** That is for the
file whose name says the wrong thing or nothing at all - a `.txt` holding a
program, a header with C++ in it, a Shalimar program the phone app saved as
`.shm`. Choosing a language sets the colouring, the layout rules and, through
Tools ▸ By language, the compiler: one choice rather than three.

**Shalimar is `.shl`, and only `.shl`.** It answered to `.shm` as well until
2026-08-23 - that is what the phone app writes, and every program it ships is
one - and the second suffix was dropped because `.shm` is not accepted
everywhere a Shalimar file has to go. One name that travels beats two that do
not. An app-written `.shm` opens as plain text; the Language menu reads it as
Shalimar without renaming it, and renaming it to `.shl` is the permanent
answer.

### Shalimar is not C with fewer rules

It is simpler in most places - one kind of comment, one kind of literal with
no escapes in it, no preprocessor, no character literal at all. But two of its
marks would be read wrongly by a C scanner, and the first of them silently:

```
n : n + 1        an assignment in Shalimar, a goto label in C
```

A label is laid out in its function's own column, so a Shalimar program
indented by the C rules walks left one statement at a time. `IndentDialect`
in `src/indent.h` is what keeps them apart, and `tests/test.cpp` holds the
program that shows the difference.

### A Shalimar project is one program, and says which

This is the part that is not like C, and the difference belongs to the
language rather than to the editor. Shalimar has **no include, no import and
no way to name another file**, and `shc` takes one program at a time. So
several `.shl` in a group are several programs, not the parts of one - which
is the ordinary shape for it: the app ships twelve examples and each is its
own program.

The project therefore names which one it builds:

```json
"build": { "target": "hello", "groups": ["Sources"] },
"groups": { "Sources": ["src/other.shl", "src/hello.shl"] }
```

With one source in the group there is nothing to decide. With more, the one
whose name matches the target's is the program; **with none matching, the
build is refused and says how many it was choosing between.** Taking whichever
came first would build a different program from the one the target names and
say nothing about it.

Shalimar beside C or C++ in one target is refused the same way C beside C++
already was, and the message names which two so the reader knows which file to
move.

### No debug information for Shalimar, and a debugger anyway

`shc` writes no debug information for any target, and that is settled rather
than pending - see the Known limitations in `../Compiler-S/README.md`. The
Debug panel says so in words rather than showing an empty pane.

What there is instead is not a consolation. The compiler already emits
`shm_line(unit, line)` before every statement so that a runtime error can name
where it happened, and a debug build offers that same position to a session
inside the program - so **a Shalimar program stops itself**, in both front
ends, with no debugger anywhere near it. `src/shalimar/` holds all of it and
`src/debugger.cpp` has nothing to say to any of it.

The one thing it cannot do is read a variable: no table of a function's names
against its frame slots is emitted, so there is nothing to read one from. The
Debug tab says which kind of empty that is - "a Shalimar program says where it
is, not what is in it" - rather than showing a blank list, and the three menu
items that need a stack or a variable are drawn faint while one is stopped.
Both halves of the editor get those words from `src/shalimar/session.cpp`, so
neither can drift into saying something else.

## The project

A project is one file, `ed1.json`, and there does not have to be one - without
it the pane on the left shows the files you have open, and nothing at all when
none are. It used to list the directory instead, which looked the same as a
project and left a closed file's name sitting in it.

```json
{
  "name": "RStudio",
  "toolchain": "auto",
  "config": "debug",
  "arch": "x86_64-windows",
  "indent": 4,
  "tabs": false,
  "groups": {
    "Rules": ["src/indent.cpp", "src/syntax.cpp"],
    "Legacy": { "files": ["src/old.c"], "toolchain": "c++" },
    "Examples": ["examples/hello.c", "examples/smart.cpp"]
  }
}
```

Seven keys, flat except the groups, and every one has a default - so `{}` is a
valid project file.

**A group is a list of files, or an object that also names a compiler.** The
plain list is not deprecated and is what a group with nothing to say is written
back as, so adding a file to a project written before any of this leaves the
file looking the way its author left it. The words are `cc1`, `cl` (or `msvc`),
`shc`, `c++`, and `auto`. Comments with `//` are allowed, because a file people edit
by hand is a file people leave notes in.

Two things are deliberately *not* in it. Where cc1 and cl live is a fact about
a machine rather than about a project, and a path written into a shared file is
a path that is wrong on the other machine - those come from `--cc1`, `--cl`,
`--cxx`, `$CC1`, `$CXX`, the directory the editor itself is installed in, or
PATH. That is also why `"toolchain": "c++"` means *this machine's C++
compiler* rather than g++ specifically: which one that is - cl, clang++, g++ -
is a fact about a machine, and the project file does not get to have an opinion
about it. And the indent settings are a number and a flag rather than a
nested object, because an object with two members in it is a nest for no gain.

A group is the project's own arrangement, not a directory: moving a file
between groups changes two lists and nothing on disk. The Project menu makes
files, renames them, moves them between groups and deletes them - the last one
asks you to type `yes`, because it is the only thing here that cannot be
undone.

**The structure is limited to two levels**, and that is a rule the project
keeps rather than a habit anyone is asked to remember: a file sits in the root
or in one directory under it, and never deeper. As many directories as you like
may sit side by side - `src`, `tests`, `examples`, `docs` and any others - but
none of them holds another. A structure nobody has to explore is one anyone can
read at a glance.

Settings in the project are what this project always does; anything named on
the command line is applied after it and wins, which is what today needs.

### Building the file, and building the project

These are two commands and neither guesses which you meant.

**`Ctrl-B` compiles the file in the edit view, and `F5` runs it.** Neither asks
the project anything. A project does not have to be open, does not have to be
shut, and does not have to hold the file - open something from anywhere with
`File > Open` and `Ctrl-B` compiles that. This is the fix-one, build-again
rhythm the editor is built around, and nothing below changes it.

**`F4` builds the project, and `Run project` on the Build menu builds and runs
it.** These read the file list and never the edit view. What they build is what
the project says it builds:

```json
"build": { "target": "sums", "groups": ["Sources"] }
```

The program is named by `target` and made from every `.c` or `.cpp` in the
groups named - headers and anything else are passed over, and groups that are
not named are not built, which is what keeps a project's own tests and examples
out of its program. Say nothing and nothing is built: that is not an error and
it is what every project written before this says. The program is left beside
`ed1.json`, so it is still there when the editor is not.

Where one compiler makes the whole of it, it does the linking too - `cc1 a.c
b.c -o prog`, since several inputs link together, and cl the same when it is
not given `/c`.

### A compiler per group

**A target can hold C and C++ together.** Each group compiles to objects with
its own compiler and the editor links them, because no compiler here takes an
object as an input - hand cc1 a `.o` and it reads it as C and complains about a
stray byte on line 1.

```
$ cc1 and clang++ 3 sources -o three
    src/main.c
    src/legacy.c
    engine/engine.cpp
$ Sources (cc1)
$ Legacy (clang++)
$ Engine (clang++)
$ linking with clang++
[built /home/you/three/three]
```

**C is the only language with a decision in it**, and that is the whole shape
of this. C++ goes to the machine's C++ compiler - cl on Windows, clang++ on a
Mac, g++ on the Linux box - and there is nothing to choose, because that is
what a C++ compiler is for and every machine has exactly one worth calling.
Shalimar goes to shc, which is the only thing that reads it. C is the one that
two compilers can both take: cc1, which this editor was written for and which
is the default, and the host's.

So a group naming its compiler is, in practice, always a group of C saying it
wants the other one - which is why `Legacy` above is the only group in that
project with a `"toolchain"` in it, and why the C++ group needs none.

A group under `auto` holding both languages is **split**, one part per
language, rather than refused. "A C and C++ project together" is the point, and
making somebody split the group by hand first would be a worse answer than the
one the compilers already give. A group that *does* name a compiler is one part
and that compiler takes all of it - which is the only way to make cl compile C
as C++ on purpose.

**Shalimar is refused, and it is the one refusal that did not go away.** In a
group with C, because no compiler takes both. In a group of its own beside C,
because of what a Shalimar object *is*: every unit exports the same three
startup symbols whatever file it came from, the runtime archive owns `main`,
and the language has no declarations for a call across a link to be checked
against. `../Compiler-S/docs/LINKING.md` has it with the linker output and with
what would have to change. A project that wants Shalimar beside C is a project
that builds two programs.

**Debug information does not mix.** cl writes CodeView, cc1 writes DWARF on two
targets and nothing on the third, and shc writes none anywhere by decision. So
the debugger is the first one any part has, and the groups it will not be able
to stop in are named in the console before the build starts rather than
discovered by pressing F8.

**An error in a file nothing has opened opens it.** cc1 stops at the first one,
and in a build of six files it is usually not the file you were looking at, so
the editor opens the one it named before putting the caret on the line and
column.

**And the debugger takes the project too.** `F8` puts the file in front of you
under a debugger, as it always has; **Debug ▸ Debug project** puts the program
the project builds under one, compiled from all its sources with `-g`. After
that the two are the same thing: F9 sets a breakpoint in whichever file you are
looking at, F7 and F6 step, and the panel shows where it stopped and what is in
scope. A breakpoint in a file that has no `main` in it is the case worth trying
- one program, several sources, and the line has to be found in the right one.

The project's program stays where it was built when the debugger stops, because
it is the project's; a single file's is a temporary thing the editor made and
clears away.

**One flat list cannot say "these files on Linux, those on Windows".** This
project's own sources are the example - `terminal.cpp` and `terminal_win.cpp`
are never built together - so a project that differs by platform wants a group
per platform and a `build` entry naming the one you are on. That is a real
limit of a list of names, and it is why this repository does not have a `build`
entry of its own.

## The panel

Three tabs:

* **Console** - the command, everything cc1 said, and the error. Enter goes to
  the line it named.
* **Debug** - what the build produced, read back out of its own assembly, and a
  line above it saying what debug information this target actually has. This is
  not a debugger and does not pretend to be: cc1 does write DWARF for two of the
  three targets now, but a debugger needs a program to run and nothing here is
  assembled, linked or run - the build stops at `-S`. What there always is, is
  the assembly: which functions came out and how much stack each takes, what is
  exported, what is called but not defined, and what strings ended up in the
  binary. That is what you look at when nothing is running. Both front ends ask
  the core for those words rather than writing them out, which is how the window
  came to be saying there was no debug information a day after there was.

  It reads both spellings, since cc1 writes GNU on two targets and MASM on the
  third and cl writes MASM always - including a string MASM broke across two
  `DB` lines, and the arm64 frame size that is put in a register before it is
  subtracted. C++ names are decorated in a listing, so on Windows
  `src/demangle_win.cpp` reads them back with `UnDecorateSymbolName`:
  `?value@Counter@demo@@QEBAHXZ` shows as `demo::Counter::value(void)const`.
  One file, compiled into both front ends.
* **Assembly** - what `-S` produced.

## Trying it

```
RStudio examples/smart.cpp --project examples --toolchain msvc
```

`examples/smart.cpp` is the one to open first. It is a small owning class - one
object, deleted once, moved rather than copied, copying refused by the compiler
rather than by the destructor - and something that exercises it and prints what
it is doing. It is C++ on purpose: cc1 compiles C, so this is the file that
shows the MSVC backend doing the work. Ctrl-B fills the assembly tab with cl's
listing.

`examples/hello.c` is the C one, for cc1, where Ctrl-T changes which of the
three architectures the assembly is for.

Handing C++ to cc1 is caught before it is run: the editor says so and points at
Ctrl-K, rather than letting a C compiler fail somewhere inside the first class
with a diagnostic that explains nothing.

## The three variants

Three things are built from this repository, and every one of them has its own
source kept here. Nothing that has been built is left without the code that
builds it.

| | what it is | built from | built by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RStudio** | the console editor on Linux and macOS | `src/*.cpp` with `src/terminal.cpp` | `make` |
| **WinConsole** | the console editor on Windows | the same `src/*.cpp` with `src/terminal_win.cpp` | `build.bat` |
| **RStudioGui** | the C++/CLI window, WinForms | `winforms/*.cpp` and the core files named in `winforms/RStudioGui.vcxproj` | `msbuild winforms\RStudioGui.vcxproj` |

**The two consoles are one front end and two terminals.** `src/editor.cpp` draws
the screen for both; `src/terminal.cpp` and `src/terminal_win.cpp` are the halves
that differ, and only they know anything about the machine. That is why the box
the panes are drawn in arrived on Windows the day it arrived on Linux - it is
not two pieces of work and there is no version of it that is only on one of
them. The binary takes its name from the command it was started as, so the
usage line names the program it was started as, which is `RStudio` on all three.

**The window shares the core and nothing else.** `RStudioGui.vcxproj` compiles
`bridge.cpp`, `Program.cpp` and `MainForm.h` together with `buffer`, `indent`,
`syntax`, `find`, `utf8`, `json`, `project`, `workspace`, `symbols`, `compile`,
`toolchain`, `path`, `process`, `debugger`, `settings` and `about` - and not
`editor.cpp`, `menu.cpp`, `tree.cpp` or either terminal, because a window has
its own menu bar, its own tree and no terminal at all. So the console's looks
and the window's looks are independent by construction: neither can take the
other with it.

**If the two consoles ever have to differ**, the place they part is
`src/editor.cpp`, and the way to do it is the way the rest of the project does
it: put the difference behind the seam that already separates them, not a
second copy of the editor. Two editors that behave nearly the same are worse
than one editor with two terminals - the same reason the window shares the core
rather than reimplementing it.

## The manual

[`help/`](help/README.md) — ten pages about the editor, one about each language
it drives, and the Shalimar specification as Appendix A. `Help ▸ Contents` in
the editor lists the same pages with a line each; `F1` shows the keys.

Appendix A is a verbatim copy of the document that lives in the Shalimar app's
own repository, carried here because this is a separate repository and a reader
has no `../Shalimar` to follow. That copy wins; `tools/check-help.sh` diffs the
two and says when they have drifted, and `tests/test.cpp` checks that every
page `Help ▸ Contents` names is a file that exists and every file is a page it
names.

## Building and checking

On a Mac or on Linux:

```
make
make check CC1=$HOME/Documents/Claude/Compiler-C/cc1 SHC=$HOME/Documents/Claude/Compiler-S/shc
```

Object files go to `src/obj`, so a listing of `src` is the code and nothing
else.

**Spell those paths with `$HOME`, never `~`.** zsh leaves a tilde alone in
`make check CC1=~/...` - it is an argument, not an assignment - and make hands
the literal `~/...` to the test process, where nothing expands it. The tell is
a build failing with a compiler that works perfectly when you run it by hand.

### All three programs at once

The editor drives two compilers, and a change to one usually comes with a
change to the other. There is one thing to open on each machine that builds
all three, with the editor built *after* the compilers it drives:

```
RStudio.xcworkspace                    macOS - RStudio, cc1, shc
RStudio.sln                            Visual Studio 2022 - RStudio, cc1, shc
make -f workspace.mk                   Linux - the same, since make is what Linux has
make -f workspace.mk check             and every suite, all three projects
```

**All six files are generated by `tools/make-projects.py` from the three
repositories' own Makefiles**, and `--check` says whether they still match. A
hand-kept project drifts, and a build tool quietly leaving a file out is not an
error - just a smaller program - so nothing says so. That happened twice here
in one day before the check existed.

**Two are kept by hand, and are checked instead of written.**
`Compiler-C/msvc/cc1.vcxproj` predates this and belongs to another repository;
the solution references it rather than writing over it, and reads its GUID out
of it so the two cannot disagree. `winforms/RStudioGui.vcxproj` is C++/CLI: one
file is compiled managed and every other file must be compiled native, and
those per-file settings are the project's whole reason for existing - a
generator that got one wrong would produce a binary that corrupts its heap
before `main`.

What can be compared is what they compile, and that is the part that drifts.
`--check` now reads both source lists and holds them against the Makefiles.
That gap was real rather than theoretical: the window's project sat outside
every check while the script's own comment claimed it counted cc1's sources
"below", which nothing did. Wiring the Shalimar session into the window needed
two files added to it by hand, and nothing would have said so if they had been
forgotten - except a link error, on the one machine that builds the window.

Which files the window compiles is `CORE_SRC` in the Makefile: the half of the
editor both front ends share. That split was asserted in this README long
before the build knew about it; now `SRC` is `CORE_SRC` plus `TERMINAL_SRC`,
and `--check` refuses to run at all if `SRC` is made of variables this script
has not been taught - which is how the second of those two drifts happened.

The three repositories are expected side by side. That is the only assumption
any of this makes, and `workspace.mk` takes `CC1_DIR` and `SHC_DIR` for the
machine where they are not called that.

### The other two machines

Both scripts relay this working tree and build it from clean there. The Windows
box has no git at all; the Linux box does, and has a clone of its own at
`~/CC1StudioWorkbench` under the old repository name - but a clone can only
have what has been pushed, and these exist to check what is in front of you
before it is committed. Each script builds in a directory of its own and leaves
that clone alone.

```
./tools/to-linux.sh              build with g++ and run both suites
./tools/to-windows.sh            build with cl and run both suites
./tools/to-windows.sh gui        msbuild the window, which build.bat never does
```

All three are worth having and each says something the others cannot.

**Linux** is the only one that can say whether the sources are ISO C++14:
Apple's libc++ hands you C++17 names under `-std=c++14`, so a C++17-ism
compiles clean on a Mac and passes the host suite. It is also where a C++ group
goes to **g++**, a routing nowhere else can check - and it caught a `size_t`
that libc++ drags in through `<vector>` and libstdc++ does not, on the day the
script was written.

**Windows** is the only machine with cl, and therefore the only one where a
target of C and C++ meets *that* linker. MSVC at `/W4 /WX` has caught two
shadowed variables clang accepted. It does Shalimar too, since 2026-08-22:
`shc.exe` is built there by `Compiler-S/build.bat`, put there by that project's
`tests/build-windows.sh`. Before that, every Shalimar case on this box skipped
itself for want of a compiler.

Both scripts copy the **build scripts and the tests** as well as the sources,
and both exclude what was built here. A stale `build.bat` and a stale
`test.cpp` have each reported an old, smaller suite that looked green; and the
first run of the Linux relay carried the Mac's own `.o` files over, where make
found them newer than the sources and the link failed with "file format not
recognized" - which reads as a broken box and is nothing of the kind.

### As a Windows Forms application

```
winforms\RStudioGui.vcxproj
```

An ordinary macOS-style menu-and-panes window: the project down the left, the
file in the middle, Console, Debug and Assembly across the bottom. It is C++/CLI
and it **consumes the native core directly** - the same indent.cpp, syntax.cpp,
project.cpp and compile.cpp the terminal editor uses, compiled into the same
binary as native code. Nothing is duplicated: laying a file out, colouring it,
reading ed1.json and choosing between cc1 and cl are all the same code running.

**File ▸ New** gives a blank buffer with no name, as the terminal's does, and
`Ctrl+PageDown` / `Ctrl+PageUp` move between the open files rather than the
terminal's `F2` and `F3`, which are Rename and Find next here. That is one of
ten places the two disagree about a key on purpose, and they are all in the
table below.

**Tools ▸ Font...** changes the face code is drawn in - Courier New, Cascadia,
whatever this machine has - fixed-pitch only, since the gutter's numbers are
laid out on every character being the same width. It applies to every tab at
once, because a file does not have a typeface: the person reading it does. And
it is remembered in `~/.ed1config.json`, beside the last project and the frame
style, for the same reason those are there. A font is not a property of a
project at all: it belongs to the person reading, and often only to the hour -
a face that is comfortable in the morning is not the one wanted at the end of a
long day. Putting it in an `ed1.json` would push one person's eyes onto everyone
who opens that project. A name that machine does not have is
quietly the default rather than a complaint at startup.

**View hides what you are not using**: `Ctrl+P` the project pane, `Ctrl+E` the
bottom panel — the terminal's own keys for both — and **Show line numbers** on
the menu, which has no key because `Ctrl+L` is Re-indent here. Line numbers take
the whole gutter with them, breakpoint dots and the stopped-at arrow included,
which is what `Ctrl-L` does in the terminal too. The menu ticks say which of the
three are showing; without them nobody would learn they can be turned off.

The terminal's other keys are here too: `Ctrl+Q` leaves, `Ctrl+D` swaps debug
and release, `Ctrl+K` goes round the compilers and `Ctrl+T` round the targets.
Those last three belong to no single menu item — they move *between* items — so
they are caught before the menus see them and shown on every item they move
between, which is what the terminal's own menu does with `Ctrl-D`. A key bound
twice would go to whichever menu was built first and leave the other advertising
a key that does nothing; that is what once happened to `F7` and Step over.

**Colouring does not disturb undo.** The window colours by applying formatting
to its text box, and Rich Edit records formatting in its undo buffer exactly as
it records typing — so `Ctrl+Z` on a file nobody had touched used to undo a
*colour*, jump the caret to it and put a star on the tab. The recording is
suspended around each colouring pass now (`ed1_undo_suspend` / `ed1_undo_resume`,
which ask Rich Edit's own `ITextDocument` and do nothing anywhere else). Undo
undoes your typing, and says `nothing to undo` when there is none.

**Enter on the Console goes to the error it is about**, as it does in the
terminal — and double-click does the same, since a console is a thing people
click at. The window already jumps there when a build fails; this is for
afterwards, once you have moved away. It is forgotten when the next build
starts, so it never takes you to something an earlier build said. `Ctrl+1`,
`Ctrl+2` and `Ctrl+3` now give the panel the keyboard as well as showing it —
without that, Enter on the console would be a key nobody could press.

**The status bar says what the next build will use** — the language, debug or
release, the compiler that will actually run with a `*` when the file chose it
rather than the menu, and the target when it means anything. `C  debug  cc1*
x86_64-windows`. It is the terminal's own line, through the same four core
functions, so the two cannot drift into different words for the same state; the
target is left out for cl, which builds for the host it was installed as, since
showing a choice that changes nothing would be the status bar telling a lie.

The menu ticks answer the same question where the choice is made. This answers
it without opening anything.

### Where the keys differ, and why

Most keys are the same in both. These ten are not. Most are decisions; two are
limits, where a terminal cannot express the key at all. Both kinds are worth
writing down: an undocumented difference is indistinguishable from a mistake to
whoever compares the two next.

| | terminal | window | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| previous / next open file | `F2` / `F3` | `Ctrl+PageUp` / `Ctrl+PageDown` | `F2` is Rename here and `F3` is Find next |
| Select all | menu only | `Ctrl+A` | the Windows convention, and the first domino |
| Re-indent | `Ctrl-A` | `Ctrl+L` | `Ctrl+A` had gone to Select all |
| line numbers | `Ctrl-L` | menu only | `Ctrl+L` had gone to Re-indent |
| Find next | `Ctrl-G` | `F3` | the Windows convention |
| Find previous | menu only | `Shift+F3` | follows `F3`; `Ctrl-G` has no shifted form to pair with |
| Replace | `Ctrl-R` | `Ctrl+H` | the Windows convention |
| close the open file | menu only | `Ctrl+W` | the Windows convention |
| move between panes | `Ctrl-W`, cycling | `Ctrl+0` … `Ctrl+4`, picking one | `Ctrl+W` had gone to Close |
| Console / Debug / Assembly | menu only | `Ctrl+1` / `Ctrl+2` / `Ctrl+3` | a terminal has no code for a control-digit |

**Two of these are limits rather than choices**, and it is the terminal that is
limited: it receives `Ctrl-1` as the digit, and `Ctrl-G` with or without shift
as the same byte. So the panel keys and a backwards-find key cannot be given to
it however much one might want to — its answer is the menu. They are in the
table so that a later comparison does not chase them as gaps.

**`Ctrl+W` is the one to be careful with**, and the only difference here that
can surprise you rather than merely fail: in the terminal it moves to the next
pane, and in the window it closes the file you are looking at. It does ask
before throwing away unsaved work — but it is still a file gone where you meant
to change focus.

**Three of those rows are one decision, not three.** Taking `Ctrl+A` for Select
all in a Windows program pushes Re-indent onto `Ctrl+L`, and that pushes line
numbers off a key altogether. Nobody chose to leave line numbers without a
shortcut; it is what was left after two conventions were honoured. The terminal
has the opposite problem and the opposite answer: it has no `Ctrl+A` to spare
for Select all, because `Ctrl-A` is the key its own users learned for laying
code out.

**Everything else the window adds is a gap being closed, not a divergence** —
`Ctrl+Q`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+T` are the terminal's keys, doing the
terminal's things.

**Help ▸ Keys** — `F1`, the same key as the terminal's — lists what is bound,
**read off the menu bar when you ask for it** rather than kept as a second list
somewhere. Rebind something and the table says so the same afternoon; there is
nothing to forget to update. It cannot be the terminal's table anyway, for the
ten reasons above. Only `Tab` is written by hand there, since it belongs to
the text box rather than to a menu.

**The project operations** are on the Project menu: new project, save project,
add this file, new file, rename, move to group and delete. New file and new
project are on the File menu as well, because that is where somebody who wants
to make something new looks first; the Project menu is where they are filed by
what they change, and both are true. None of them is
written twice - `src/workspace.cpp` holds what changing a project actually
involves (check the rule, do the disk work, keep the list in step, write the
project back), and both front ends call it. The terminal asks its questions on
the message line and the window asks them in a dialog; what happens after the
answer is the same code. Deleting asks plainly, with No already chosen.

**Where a new file or project goes is said before it is made**, in the dialog
that asks for the name, and the directory the project is in stays on the status
line. A new project asks for that directory rather than using whichever one the
editor happened to be started in - which is not a thing anybody can see.

**Leaving asks about every open file, not the one in front.** `Ctrl-Q` and File
▸ Quit both name the first file with changes in it and say how many others
there are; pressing `Ctrl-Q` again leaves anyway, and anything else typed in
between takes the offer back. The file you are looking at is rarely the one you
forgot to save, which is what made checking only that one worse than useless.

**The project pane can be used without a mouse.** `Ctrl-0` puts the keyboard in
it, the arrows move, Enter opens what is picked - or folds a group heading, which
has no file behind it - and `Ctrl-4` goes back to the text. Before this the pane
answered a double-click and nothing else: Tab belongs to the text box, which
lays a line out with it, so there was no way in at all.

**A file has one tab however you reach it.** The pane hands out paths written
with forward slashes, because that is how the project file writes them, while
the command line and the open dialog give backslashes - so opening from the pane
a file that was already open used to open it a second time, showing what was on
disk. That reads as your changes having been thrown away, which is why it counts
as more than untidiness. Paths are compared as one canonical name now.

**Nothing unsaved is thrown away without being asked about.** Closing a tab
whose file has changes in it, and closing the window with any such tab open,
both ask - Save, Don't save, Cancel - and Cancel leaves everything where it
was. A tab wears a `*` while it has changes, so the question names something
you can already see. The terminal half refuses instead of asking, because its
whole answer has to fit on the message line; the window has room to ask
properly.

**Tabs for the files you have open**, one text box each, so every tab keeps its
own caret, scroll position and undo history. Opening a file already open brings
its tab forward rather than opening it twice, and an untouched unnamed tab is
reused rather than left behind. **Line numbers** are painted down the left, with
the caret's own line picked out; the gutter widens for the last line and does
not shrink back as you scroll. The gutter is double-buffered, since it is
repainted on every keystroke and a plain panel clears itself first - which is
seen as a blink.

**While you type, only the line you are typing on is coloured**, and a quarter of
a second after you stop, the screen is coloured properly. Colouring the visible
window freezes the box and repaints all of it, which is right when a file
arrives or the view moves and is far too much for one keystroke - it showed as
the line numbers juddering, because the whole text area was being redrawn per
character. The state the lexer is in at the start of the line being typed on is
remembered, so typing does not re-read the file above it for every keystroke.

**Colouring is done to what is on the screen**, and a screenful either side of
it. The lexer still runs from the top of the file, because a comment opened on
line 3 colours line 900, but that part is native and costs nothing worth
counting; what costs is the box, where every coloured run is a selection. While
it happens the box is frozen with `WM_SETREDRAW` and its scroll position is put
back with `EM_GETSCROLLPOS` / `EM_SETSCROLLPOS` afterwards - a selection scrolls
itself into view, so without that, opening a parser walks visibly down to its
last line. What that buys is colour as you type, on a file of any size.

**The panes are settled once the window has a size**, not while it is being
built: a `SplitContainer` that is not in a window yet is 150 by 100, and both a
splitter distance and a panel minimum are checked against the size it has at
that moment. A distance is refused quietly there, leaving each pane at half -
a third of the width for short filenames, half the height for a dozen lines of
output - and a minimum is refused loudly, with an exception that stops the
window appearing at all. `Arrange` sets both, on the same rule the terminal
front end follows: the project pane and the output panel take what they need,
about a quarter of the height for the output, and the code takes everything
else, including everything the window gains when it is made larger.

It edits the way the terminal one does. A newline takes the indentation its
place asks for, a typed `}` `#` or `:` puts its own line where it belongs, and
Tab in the leading space lays the line out rather than adding a step. Find,
find-next, find-previous and replace call the same `find.cpp`. Undo, redo, cut,
copy, paste and select-all are the text box's own - it keeps the history the
typing went into, and there is no sense in keeping a second one beside it.

Typed flat into the window, `int twice(int n) {` and four lines after it come
back laid out, with the closing brace snapping to column 0 as it is typed.

`winforms/show.ps1` starts it, optionally builds, and saves a picture of the
window - which is how this front end has been looked at throughout, since it is
written on a Mac and only runs on Windows:

```
.\show.ps1 -Project C:\Users\me\Editor -Files examples\smart.cpp -Build
```

It photographs the editor's own window with `PrintWindow` rather than grabbing
the screen, so it gets the window even when something is in front of it and
captures nothing else that happens to be on the desktop. A window needs a
desktop and an ssh session has none, so from a remote shell it must be run in
the logged-on session - the script's own header gives the `schtasks /it`
incantation for that.

The managed form talks to it through `winforms/bridge.h`, which names no C++
type at all - opaque handles and char pointers, nothing else. That is not
fastidiousness; three separate things about mixed native/managed binaries have
to be respected, and each one was found the hard way:

* A translation unit that includes `<fstream>` gets iostreams' static
  initialisation, and linking it corrupts the heap **before main runs**. The
  core uses stdio now.
* A function-local `static` with a destructor registers an `atexit` handler the
  first time it is reached, and that corrupts the heap too. The three in the
  core are made once and never destroyed.
* The managed side must not instantiate the STL the native side instantiates.
* A global or `static` of a managed type is refused outright - `C3145` - since
  there would be nothing rooting it for the collector. A `static` member
  function returning it does the same job and is allowed.

The second of those was found by giving the program its own debugger: there was
no debugger on that machine at the time, so `bridge.cpp` installs a vectored
exception handler
that walks and symbolises its own stack into `ed1-fault.log`. It printed
`Json::get -> atexit -> register_onexit_function -> RtlSizeHeap` and named the
line.

### In Xcode

```
open Editor.xcodeproj
```

An ordinary macOS command line tool target, compiled by clang++ - `Editor.xcodeproj`
holds nothing but a target, two configurations and the same files `src` already
had. Debug and Release both build, and the binary Xcode produces was put
through the whole session harness rather than merely run once: 70 checks, the
same as make's.

The project file is **generated**, by `make xcodeproj`, and its source list is
read out of the Makefile. A hand-kept project drifts - someone adds a file to
the Makefile, forgets the other one, and Xcode quietly builds yesterday's
editor. There is one source list and it is the Makefile's.

One thing to know before reaching for the Run button: RStudio is a terminal
program, and Xcode's console is a pipe rather than a terminal. Started from
there it cannot put the terminal into raw mode and will print escape sequences
instead of drawing. Build and debug it in Xcode; run it in Terminal, and attach
from Xcode if you want breakpoints while it is running.

On Windows, where there is no make:

```
build
build check
```

`check` runs both halves. `tests/test.cpp` checks the pieces that never see a
terminal. `tests/session.cpp` drives the editor itself - it types into it,
walks its menus, and then looks at what landed on the screen and on the disk:
that a function typed flat comes back laid out, that keywords are coloured,
that New file makes a file and puts it in the project, that a path two
directories deep is refused, that Rename moves it and the project follows, that
Delete answered with anything but `yes` keeps the file, and that undo takes back a run of
typing and redo returns it, that the modified marker comes back when you undo
past a save and goes when you redo to it, that a selection can be copied,
cut, pasted and typed over, that a file of Urdu and accented text survives
being saved and that backspace takes a whole letter out of it, that find lands the caret on the right line and
Ctrl-G moves on, that replace changes the text and quitting
without saving leaves the file alone, and that a build lands the caret on the
line the compiler named and that its two configurations produce different
code. One program for both machines, rather
than a shell script and a PowerShell script that would drift apart.

Set `CC1` to run the cc1 build cases; the cl ones need nothing, since the
editor finds Visual Studio itself.

`build.bat` finds Visual Studio 2022 itself. The search is pinned to `[17.0,18.0)`
on purpose - a bare `vswhere -latest` reaches past 2022 to any newer Visual
Studio on the machine, which is not the toolset this is built with. Both builds
are warnings-as-errors: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic` for clang and gcc,
`/W4 /WX` for MSVC. MSVC found a shadowed variable that clang did not, which is
the argument for building both.

## Why it is laid out the way it is

Only `terminal_win.cpp` is Windows-specific, and it is a hundred lines. Windows
10 and later speak the same escape sequences as a Unix terminal once
`ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` and `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` are
set, so the drawing, the status bar and the key decoding are one piece of code
on both machines. The key decoding in particular lives in `terminal_common.cpp`
rather than in each platform file: two copies of that drifting apart is the
house bug, and this is the one place it was easy to prevent.

**This is C++14, and `src/path.cpp` is what that costs.** cc1 is written in
C++14, so the editor that drives it is too - one standard across the arena,
enforced by all three toolchains rather than agreed and forgotten. The only
thing in here that wanted C++17 was `<filesystem>`, and what was actually used
of it was small: joining and splitting paths, making one absolute or relative
to another, listing a directory, and four operations on files. So it is written
out, `opendir` on one machine and `FindFirstFile` on the other, in one file
behind one set of functions - a single place the two spellings can drift apart,
small enough to read, and with 35 cases of its own. Everything works in forward
slashes and hands them back, which is what the project file already wanted.

`buffer`, `indent`, `menu` and `tree` touch no screen and no OS. `indent`, `syntax`, `json`, `project`, `path` and
the diagnostic parser are the pieces with a contract, and `tests/test.cpp`
checks them - 332 cases, including that a Windows path's drive letter is not
mistaken for a `line:col` separator, that a brace inside a string is not
counted, and that `class` is a keyword in C++ and nothing in particular in C,
and that cl's `bad.c(3,13)` is read as well as cc1's `bad.c:3:13`. They run on
both machines.

One bug in here could only have been found by running it on Windows: `_popen`
hands its string to `cmd /c`, and cmd removes the first and last quote when a
command has both a quoted program and quoted arguments - which every command
here does, since paths hold spaces. The fix is an extra pair around the whole
thing for cmd to eat. Until then the compiler was never reached, and cmd said
"The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" instead.

## Usage

```
RStudio [file.c] [--project dir] [--toolchain cc1|msvc] [--compiler path]
    [--cc1 path] [--width n] [--tabs] [--case-indent]
```

`--cc1` names the compiler; `$CC1` and `--compiler` do the same. Told none of
them, both front ends look for a `cc1` **beside the editor** before asking
PATH - `make product` and `build.bat product` put the editor and the compiler
it drives in one directory, and that directory should work whatever directory
you started the editor in. A compiler shipped with a copy of the editor is the
one that copy is meant to run, so it is preferred to whatever PATH would have
answered. Indentation is four spaces because that is what cc1's own sources
use, and they contain no tab at all.
