# Why this exists rather than four `make clean`s: a build leaves things in
# places no single Makefile owns - the shared build directory, the suites'
# tests/out-* scratch, the binaries a workspace build put somewhere else - and
# porting a tree means tarring it, where every one of those is dead weight.
#
# **The rule that makes it safe to run anywhere: nothing git tracks is ever
# removed.** That is not caution for its own sake. `Compiler-C/lib` is sixteen
# tracked header files, and `Compiler-C/build` is a tracked *file*, while in
# Compiler-S `lib/` is the runtime archives and is output. The same two names
# mean opposite things one directory apart, so a list of names cannot be
# trusted and the repository is asked instead. A project with no git checkout -
# the Windows box has none - falls back to its .gitignore, and anything not
# matched there is left alone and reported.
