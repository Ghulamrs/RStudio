// to objects with its own compiler, and the objects meet at the linker, which
// does not care which compiler wrote them.
//
// The linker is named here rather than reached through a compiler, because no
// compiler in this editor takes an object as an input: handing cc1 a .o gets
// "stray '\377' in program", the object read as C.

//
// On Windows this is link.exe with the C runtime named, the same list cc1's own
// driver names and for the same reason - cc1's objects carry no /DEFAULTLIB
// directive, so nothing else says which CRT to use. The static one is chosen
// because that is what cc1 has always linked; cl's objects are compiled /MT or
// /MTd to match, which is a real difference from cl on its own and is why
// objectRecipe asks for the configuration.

// Everywhere else it is 'cc', the same host driver cc1 hands its own linking
