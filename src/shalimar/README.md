# The Shalimar half

Everything in this directory is about one language and touches nothing that
serves the other two. `src/debugger.cpp` drives gdb, lldb and cdb, and has
nothing to say to any of this; none of this has anything to say to it.

That is not tidiness. A Shalimar program **stops itself**. The compiler emits
`shm_line(unit, line)` before every statement so that a runtime error can name
where it happened, and a debug build offers that same position to a session
inside the program. There is no debug format to read, no `.pdb`, no DWARF
unit, and no debugger to find or install — so there is nothing here that the
three-debuggers file could have been extended to do.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `channel.h/.cpp` | a child with its three streams kept **apart** |
| `session.h/.cpp` | the protocol, in the editor's own vocabulary |

**Why not `editor::Process`.** That one joins a child's error output to its
ordinary output on purpose — a debugger says useful things on both and the
editor shows one console. Here it is the opposite: the session talks on
standard error and the program prints on standard output, and joining them
would put a `#stop` in the middle of a line the program was half way through
writing. So `Channel` keeps them separate, and is otherwise smaller than
`Process`: no console variant, and no marker discipline, because a protocol
line is a line and arrives whole.

**What is borrowed.** `editor::Stop` and `editor::StackFrame`, from
`debugger.h`. "Where the program is" is one idea and the editor draws it one
way; duplicating the words would be worse than including the header. Borrowing
vocabulary is not sharing machinery.

The protocol itself, and the debug-versus-release boundary it depends on, are
in `../../../Compiler-S/docs/DEBUGGING.md`.

## Where this stands

Built, linked into `RStudio`, and driven against a real program by
`steppingShalimar()` in `tests/test.cpp`: a breakpoint by file and line, a
stop, a step in, a step out, the program's own printing coming back with it,
and a release build refusing to be stopped because it has no code for it.

**Wired to the Debug menu, in both front ends.** F9 sets a breakpoint, F8
builds and starts, F7 and F6 step, and the Debug tab shows where the program is
standing — the same keys as the other three languages, routed by
`Editor::debugging()` and `Editor::debuggingShalimar()` rather than by a flag
the editor keeps, so there is nothing that can fall out of step with what is
actually running.

**The window reaches it through `winforms/bridge.cpp`**, which holds a
`Session` beside the `Debugger` and asks which of the two is live — the same
question `Editor` asks, in the same words, so there is one answer and not two.
`rstudio_debugger_start` takes the compiler and the target rather than a debugger
for that reason: the choosing is native, and the form never learns there are
two halves. `theWindowStoppingShalimar()` in `tests/test.cpp` drives the whole
of it through `rstudio_` calls, and it stops a program on Windows, where cc1's own
debugging cannot go at all.

Three things the routing had to say rather than assume:

- **`shc --debug` is what a debug configuration means here.** `configFlags`
  used to give shc nothing and say debug and release were the same program.
  They were, until shc grew `--debug`; after that, F8 built a release binary
  and found nothing in it to stop. The compiler's output is still identical
  between the two — what changes is which runtime archive is linked.
- **The refusals about a debugger do not apply.** `dbg_for` answers
  `DebuggerNone` for shc and is right to: there is no gdb, lldb or cdb in this
  at all. So Shalimar is asked about before that check, not after it.
- **No variables, and the tab says so.** An empty list would have read as
  "this line has none" rather than "there are none to have". Watches and
  walking the stack refuse in the same voice, and the tab does not offer keys
  for them. Those sentences are `saysWhereOnly`, `saysHowDeepOnly`,
  `releaseHasNoSession` and `didNotArm` in `session.cpp` — written down once
  because two front ends have to say them, and the terminal half had them
  written out where the window could not reach them. None of them names a key:
  which key changes a configuration is each front end's own business.
